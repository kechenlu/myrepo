#8255 flights have a missing dep_time, 8255 flights have a missing dep_delay, 
#8713 flights have a missing arr_time. 9430 flights have a missing arr_delay,
#9430 flights have a missing air_time. they might be represent the flights got
#canceled.

#2.Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to
#compute with because theyâ€™re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a 
# more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

#3.Look at the number of canceled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the
#proportion of canceled flights related to the average delay? Use multiple 
#dyplr operations, all on one line, concluding with 
#ggplot(aes(x= ,y=)) + geom_point()
